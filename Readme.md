# Smart AI-Based Expense & Credit Card Management System

The Smart AI-Based Expense & Credit Card Management System is a web-based personal finance management application designed to help users track daily expenses, manage credit card usage, monitor bill payments, and receive intelligent AI-powered insights for better financial decision-making.

The system consists of a frontend interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend server developed using the Flask framework with MySQL as the database. The platform includes role-based operations such as user registration, login authentication, expense tracking, category management, bill reminders, and credit card monitoring.

One of the core highlights of this project is the integration of AI-driven features, which analyze the user’s spending patterns and provide meaningful insights such as:

Predicted next-month expenses

Overspending alerts in specific categories

Credit card due warnings

Personalized money-saving recommendations

These AI features are implemented using rule-based intelligence and statistical estimation techniques, ensuring lightweight performance while delivering smart analysis.

The system enables users to:

Add and categorize expenses

View expense summaries and monthly charts

Track bill payments with due-date alerts

Manage multiple credit cards and monitor their outstanding balances

Receive dashboard-level AI insights to improve financial discipline

Overall, the project demonstrates the integration of full-stack development, database management, and AI-powered analytics in a single functional system. It helps users achieve better financial control by combining automation, visualization, and intelligent recommendations.
